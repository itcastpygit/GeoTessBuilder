# this properties file will result in a single GeoTessGrid
# object consisting of 3 multi-level tessellations.  The 
# triangles on the top level of each tessellation will each be
# approximately uniform in the geographic dimensions.  
# Tessellation 0 will have triangles with edge lengths of about 32 degrees
# Tessellation 1 will have triangles with edge lengths of about 16 degrees
# Tessellation 2 will have triangles with edge lengths of about 4 degrees.
# All three tessellations will be stored together in the same output file.
# Separate vtk files will be generated for each tessellation for visualization.

# specify GeoTessBuilder grid construction mode.
