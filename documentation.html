<h2>GeoTess Builder</h2>

GeoTessBuilder is an command line driven application written in java that allows users to contruct new GeoTessGrid objects.  The grids can consist of multiple multi-level tessellations to allow variable resolution in the radial direction, and their geographic resolution can be controlled by specifying polygons, paths and points about which the resolution should be varied.  See the <a href="GeoTessUsersManual2020.pdf">User's Manual</a> for more details.

<h3>Configuration</h3>
A bash script called <tt>configure_geotessbuilder.sh</tt>
is provided that generates a two-line executable script called
<tt>geotessbuilder</tt> that will launch the GeoTessBuilder
application.  The configuration script also prints to
the screen a recommended addition to the user's PATH
environment variable that will make the executable
accessible from any directory. No modifications to the
user's environment are performed by the configuration
script.  After running <tt>configure_geotessbuilder.sh</tt> and making
the recommended addition to the user's <tt>.cshrc</tt> or <tt>.bash_profile</tt>
file, executing the command <tt>geotessbuilder</tt> from any directory will
launch GeoTessBuilder.

<h3>Example Properties Files</h3>

GeoTessBuilder is configured using properties files. Several example properties files are provided in the GeoTessBuilderExamples directory.
